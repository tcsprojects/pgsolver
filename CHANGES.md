Jan 17 2010		Oliver Friedmann

Mar 28 2009		Oliver Friedmann

   of expstratimpr enforcing exponential behaviour w.r.t. Voege and Puri.


Mar 27 2009		Martin Lange
 - Added .depend compilation
 - Added new elevator verification generator
 - Jurdzinski Generator is currently broken.


Mar 23 2009		Oliver Friedmann
 - Removed external solver for linear inequality systems. Created a
   very slow but exact solution for dpgs. Megiddo's algorithm for
   solving inequality systems should be implemented.
   Note: Exponential Strategy Improvement Examples also work with
   Puri's Algorithm.


Mar 22 2009		Oliver Friedmann
 - Added experimental solver using the standard reduction to DPG (experimental).
   It requires GLPK as well as OCAMLGLPK to be compiled into PGSolver.
   Unfortunately, floating point precision only suffices for very very very
   small games. Therefore, this algorithm is practically unusable in this
   context. One should implement another version relying on exact rational
   numbers; since GLPK is not able to exact parameters other than float,
   one has to implement a native linear inequality solver. Megiddo's
   algorithm should suffice.


Mar 20 2009		Oliver Friedmann
 - Improved Small Progress Measures Implementation: It now computes the SPM for both
   players simultaneously and checks after a number of steps if there is already a
   stable dominion and if so, the respective spms of the other player are marked as top.


Mar 17 2009		Oliver Friedmann
 - Enriched Arg2-Module s.t. sub-parsing is supported
 - Added support for generators in PGSolver; use LINKGENERATORS=YES in Config
   file to enable linking of generators into PGSolver

 
Mar 10 2009		Oliver Friedmann
 - Added SATSolversForOcaml/SatSolverMods which should be included in Makefiles using Sat Solvers

 - Added printing of parsable solution and strategy
 - Added parsing of parsable solution and strategy


Feb 26 2009		Oliver Friedmann
 - Moved global fixed point algorithm to temporary folder


Feb 25 2009		Oliver Friedmann
 - Added global fixed point algorithm; generated strategy is NOT correct ATM
 - Fixed Makefiles s.t. it really compiles without gcc


Feb 12 2009		Oliver Friedmann
 - Updated configuration files s.t. SATSolvers have to be configured only in the respective config file
 - Updated documentation as well


Feb 11 2009		Martin Lange
 - Added min-party / max-parity coversion
 - Node: jurdzinskigame generates min-parity games!

 - Added install.txt
 - Updated documentation w.r.t. parser
 - Updated tools w.r.t. parser

   The second parameter enables / disables sanity checking
 - Parser: Removed parser routines from Paritygame.ml (and moved them to parser.mly)
 - Model Checker: Now it returns an underapproximation instead of a solution to the whole scc. Major speed up.


Jan 25 2009		Oliver Friedmann
 - Updated documentation: Model Checker Generator, Obfuscator
 - Added Model Checker worst-case generator
 - Obfuscator: Fixed edge obfuscation, New command line parameters.

Jan 21 2009		Oliver Friedmann
 - Enhanced Clustered Random Generator

Jan 19 2009		Oliver Friedmann
 - Altered parser s.t. it reads both formats
 - Removed local config files from repository
 - Added changelog.txt, will be included in make package
 - Added Makefile commands
 	- satsolvers: Compiles Sat Solvers
 	- cleansat: Cleans Sat Solvers
 	- cleanall: Cleans everything and sat solvers
 - Modified Makefile commands
 	- all, pgsolver: Call now automatically satsolvers
 - Added Config.default and satsolvers/Config.default disabling by default
   all external sat solvers
 - Modified Makefile and satsolvers/Makefile s.t. Config.default is used iff
   Config is not existing
 - Updated make package. Includes default config files. Creates a pgsolver
   sub-directory. Tested it on a clean machine without any sat solver and
   it worked.
 - All tools, generators etc. should output the new format of parity games.
 - Removed useless generators: Centeredcycleinvariantdemo, Stratimprovelift,
   Succcollapse


Jan 16 2009		Martin Lange
 - Altered random generation: See src/tools/randomutils.ml
   val get_pairwise_different_from_range : int -> int -> int -> int list
 - Altered parser: Parity games now need to start with the line "parity n;"
   where n is supposed to be the heighest occurring node number. Increases
   parser performance.
